# Keep this list synchronized with AGENTS.md. Names are matched as Cargo package
# names (the first whitespace-delimited field), not as substrings, so a package
# such as `tokio-metrics` cannot hide a direct `tokio` match and unrelated names
# do not produce false positives. `libc` is intentionally absent: both direct
# and transitive libc are permitted. Serde is also absent because it is an
# explicitly optional util/web feature, never a core transport dependency.
